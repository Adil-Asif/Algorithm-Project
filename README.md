# Algorithm-Project
Algortihm Porject for 5 semester contains 10 different algortihm. This is a Web Based Application

This project defines the implementation of different algorithms that were part of the
course CS302. The Project is designed with a user-friendly and eye appealing
interface where the user can select the required algorithm and see how the output
changes on the given input. The Project also displays some basic information related
to the specific algorithm.

The input files are designed with the help of the given requirements . We were required to make 10 data
sets for each type of requirement. For Longest Common Subsequence , Shortest Common Supersequence and Levenshtein Distance we had to design 2 different strings from the letters of
words and the length of the random generated from the given letters should be between 30 to 100.
The second type of test case was for Longest Increasing Subsequence , Matrix Chain Multiplication , Partition-problem and Coin-change-making-problem where we had to generate n numbers of integers where n
varies from 30-100 and the number should be between 0-100.
The third type of test case was for Rod Cutting Problem and 0-1-knapsack-problem where we had to generate n numbers of sets of w weights and v
values where n varies from 10-100 and the w and v should be between 1-100.
The fourth type of test case was for Word Break Problem where we had to generate a dictionary consisting of randomly
generating words.
